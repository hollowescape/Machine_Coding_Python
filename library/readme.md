Okay, excellent! Let's dive into a new problem.

How about we design and implement a Simplified Library Management System?

This problem will allow us to explore different aspects of Object-Oriented Design, data management, and state tracking within a different domain.

New Problem: Simplified Library Management System
Goal: To create a system that allows a library to manage its books, members, and book lending/returning processes.

Core Functionalities to Implement:

Book Management:

Add new books to the library.

Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.

Display details of a specific book.

Member Management:

Register new library members.

Search for members by ID or name.

Display details of a specific member.

Lending & Returning:

Allow members to borrow books (if available).

Allow members to return borrowed books.

Track the due date for borrowed books.

Availability Tracking:

Ensure a book can only be borrowed if it's available.

Update book status upon borrowing and returning.

Error Handling: Implement custom exceptions for scenarios like "Book not found," "Member not found," "Book not available," "Book already borrowed by this member," etc.
