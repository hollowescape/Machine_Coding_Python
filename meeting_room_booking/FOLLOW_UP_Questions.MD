Answers to Follow-Up Questions:
1. Time Complexity & Optimizations:
Room.is_available_for_slot (Current: O(N) where N is the number of bookings in that room):

Limitation: For a room with hundreds or thousands of bookings, a linear scan could become slow. If this operation is very frequent, it will be a bottleneck.

Optimization using specialized data structures (O(log N)):

Interval Trees or Segment Trees: These data structures are specifically designed for efficient querying of overlapping intervals. Instead of a simple sorted list, each Room could maintain its bookings in an Interval Tree.

How it works: An Interval Tree preprocesses a set of intervals (our bookings). When a query interval ([start_time, end_time)) comes, it can find all overlapping intervals in O(log N + K) time, where K is the number of overlapping intervals found. For checking availability (i.e., any overlap), K would be 1, so it's effectively O(log N).

Implementation: These are more complex to implement from scratch in an interview but are the ideal solution for this problem in a real system. Python doesn't have a built-in Interval Tree, so one would need to use a library or implement a simplified version.

Alternative (Simpler optimization for lists): If N is "medium" (tens/hundreds) and not extreme, keeping the list sorted is still beneficial. We can potentially use bisect_left to find a starting point for our scan, limiting the search space, but still, worst-case is O(N) if the overlap is with the very first booking.

list_user_bookings (Current: O(M) + O(M log M) where M is total bookings):

Limitation: Iterating through _all_bookings_index (which could be millions of bookings) and then filtering and sorting can be inefficient if called frequently or with many total bookings.

Optimization:

Maintain an Inverted Index: Add another internal dictionary to MeetingRoomBookingSystem: _user_bookings_index: dict[str, list[Booking]].

When a booking is made, add it to _all_bookings_index AND append it to the relevant user's list in _user_bookings_index.

When a booking is cancelled, remove it from both indices.

Benefit: list_user_bookings would then be a simple O(K) lookup, where K is the number of bookings for that specific user. The list for each user could also be kept sorted upon insertion (using bisect.insort_left for each user's list) if always needing sorted output, making the lookup O(K) without an extra O(K log K) sort step.

2. Scalability & Persistence:
Persistence (Data Storage):

Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL): This is the most common and robust solution.

Tables: Rooms table (room_id, capacity, features), Bookings table (booking_id, room_id, user_id, start_time, end_time).

ACID Properties: Guarantees atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability for transactions.

ORMs (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM): Would be used in Python to map database tables to Python objects, simplifying database interactions.

NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra): Could be considered for higher flexibility or specific scaling needs, but relational databases are often preferred for strong consistency requirements like preventing double-bookings.

High Volume & Horizontal Scaling:

Microservices Architecture: Break down the monolithic system into smaller, independent services:

Room Service: Manages room inventory.

Booking Service: Handles booking/cancellation logic.

User Service: Manages user profiles (if needed).

These services communicate via APIs (REST, gRPC) or message queues.

Load Balancers (e.g., Nginx, AWS ELB): Distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the Booking Service.

Database Sharding/Partitioning: For massive datasets, split data across multiple database servers (e.g., shard by room_id or date).

Database Replication (Read Replicas): For read-heavy workloads, redirect read requests to replica databases, offloading the primary write database.

Caching Layer (e.g., Redis): Cache frequently accessed room availability schedules or popular room bookings to reduce database load. This would be an LRU cache or a time-based cache.

Asynchronous Processing (Message Queues like Kafka/RabbitMQ): For non-critical operations (e.g., sending email notifications after booking), place requests on a queue and process them asynchronously. This decouples components and improves responsiveness.

Fault-Tolerance:

Redundancy: Run multiple instances of each service behind a load balancer. If one instance fails, others can take over.

Database Backups & Replication: Regular backups and having standby/replica databases ensure data durability.

Circuit Breakers: Prevent cascading failures by quickly failing requests to unhealthy downstream services.

Global Consistency:

In a distributed system, achieving strong consistency (like ACID guarantees) across multiple services or database shards is complex.

Distributed Transactions: Using two-phase commit (2PC) or sagas can maintain atomicity across services, but they add complexity and latency.

Eventual Consistency: For less critical data, allow temporary inconsistencies that resolve over time (e.g., user booking list might be slightly delayed). For booking systems, strong consistency is usually preferred for actual bookings.

3. Concurrency & Atomicity:
Race Conditions:

Double Booking: If two users simultaneously check_room_availability_for_slot for the same room and time, both might find it available. Then, both proceed to book_room, leading to an overlapping booking. The current is_available_for_slot check and add_booking are not atomic.

Prevention and Atomicity:

Database Transactions & Locking: This is the most robust approach.

Start Transaction: Begin a database transaction.

Lock Room/Time Slot: Before checking availability, acquire a lock on the Room record for the specific room_id and the proposed time_slot. In SQL, this could be SELECT ... FOR UPDATE on the Bookings table, checking for any conflicts, or even a row-level lock on the Room table itself (though less granular).

Check Availability: Re-check availability within the lock. This is crucial because another transaction might have booked the slot between the initial read and the lock acquisition.

Insert Booking: If available, insert the new booking record.

Commit/Rollback: If all successful, commit the transaction. If any failure (e.g., overlap detected during re-check), rollback.

Application-Level Locking (Single Instance): In a single-instance Python application, you could use threading.Lock or asyncio.Lock around the book_room method or the Room's internal booking logic. This is simpler but doesn't scale to multiple service instances.

Distributed Locking (Multiple Instances): For a horizontally scaled system, a distributed lock manager (e.g., Redis Redlock, Apache ZooKeeper) would be needed. Before attempting a booking for a room_id, acquire a distributed lock for that room_id. This ensures only one instance can modify that room's schedule at a time. This adds complexity and latency.

Optimistic Concurrency Control: Instead of explicit locks, you could add a version number to a room's booking schedule. When booking, read the schedule and its version. Perform checks. Before writing back, verify the version hasn't changed. If it has, another booking occurred, so retry or fail. Less contention but requires retry logic.

4. Advanced Features/Enhancements:
Find Any Available Room for a Slot:

Approach: Iterate through all _rooms. For each Room, call room.is_available_for_slot(start, end). Collect all rooms for which it returns True.

Optimization: If room features are considered (e.g., "find a room with a projector"), filter rooms by features first before checking availability. For extremely large numbers of rooms, an index mapping available slots to rooms might be considered, but it's very complex to maintain dynamically.

Recurring Bookings:

Model Extension:

Introduce a RecurringBooking entity with fields like pattern (e.g., "weekly", "daily", "monthly"), end_date_for_recurrence, and potentially a parent_booking_id.

Each individual occurrence would still be a Booking object.

Implementation:

When a recurring booking request comes in, the system would generate all individual Booking instances based on the pattern and attempt to book them one by one.

If any individual instance overlaps, the system could either:

Fail the entire recurring booking.

Book all possible non-overlapping occurrences and notify the user about the failed ones.

Cancellation could apply to a single instance or the entire recurring series (by deleting all associated Booking objects linked by parent_booking_id).

Room Capacity & Attendees:

Room Model: Add a _capacity: int attribute to the Room class.

book_room Method: Modify book_room to accept num_attendees: int. Before creating the Booking, add a check: if num_attendees > room.get_capacity(): raise InvalidInputError("Attendees exceed room capacity.").

Booking Model: Optionally, add num_attendees to the Booking object itself for record-keeping.

Different Room Types/Features:

Room Model Extension:

Add a _type: RoomTypeEnum (e.g., CONFERENCE, HUDDLE) and _features: list[str] (e.g., "projector", "whiteboard", "video_conf").

Querying: Implement a find_rooms_by_features(required_features: list[str]) method that filters available rooms based on these attributes before checking time availability.

Inheritance vs. Composition:

Composition (recommended for features): A Room has a list of features. Flexible for adding new features without changing class hierarchy.

Inheritance (for distinct room behaviors): If different room types have vastly different booking rules or logic, then ConferenceRoom(Room) or HuddleRoom(Room) could be considered, but often composition is sufficient.

5. Monitoring & Observability:
Logging:

Structured Logging: Use a format like JSON for logs (e.g., with structlog or logging.basicConfig(format='json')). This allows easy parsing and analysis by log aggregation tools (e.g., ELK stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

Levels: Use INFO for routine operations (booking created, cancelled), WARNING for non-fatal issues (invalid room ID during registration), ERROR for failures (booking overlap, database errors), DEBUG for verbose development logs.

Context: Include request_id, user_id, room_id, booking_id in logs to trace a specific operation across multiple log lines.

Metrics: Use a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog) to collect and visualize key performance indicators.

API Performance:

Request Rate: book_room calls/sec, get calls/sec.

Latency: Average, P90, P99 latency for book_room, cancel_booking, check_availability.

Error Rate: Percentage of failed API calls (e.g., 5xx errors for internal issues, 4xx for client errors like overlap).

Business Metrics:

Number of successful bookings per day/hour.

Number of cancelled bookings.

Number of failed booking attempts (and reasons: overlap, room not found).

Room utilization (percentage of time rooms are booked).

Peak concurrent bookings.

Resource Utilization: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O of the application servers and database.

Alerting: Set up alerts based on these metrics:

High error rates on critical APIs.

Latency exceeding a threshold.

Room utilization reaching critical levels.

Service instance health checks failing.

Tracing:

For a microservices architecture, implement distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry). This allows you to see the entire flow of a request across multiple services, helping to pinpoint performance bottlenecks or errors in complex interactions.

### Monitoring & Observability

1. **Metrics**:
   - Track room utilization rates, booking success rates, and cancellation rates.
   - Monitor API performance (e.g., latency, error rates).

2. **Logging**:
   - Use structured logging to capture booking details (e.g., room_id, user_id, booking_id).
   - Include error details for failed operations.

3. **Alerting**:
   - Set up alerts for high error rates or low room availability.
   - Notify administrators of potential system bottlenecks or failures.

These considerations elevate the basic in-memory solution to a production-grade system, demonstrating a holistic understanding of software engineering beyond just functional correctness.
