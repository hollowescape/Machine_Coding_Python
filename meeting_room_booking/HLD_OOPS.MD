High-Level Design & OOP Principles:
The system will be composed of three main entities, reflecting the real-world domain:

Booking: Represents a single confirmed reservation for a room.

Attributes: booking_id, room_id, user_id, start_time, end_time.

Methods: overlaps(other_start, other_end) to check for time conflicts.

Room: Represents a physical meeting room. It's responsible for managing its own schedule.

Attributes: room_id, _bookings (a list of Booking objects, kept sorted by start_time).

Methods:

is_available_for_slot(start, end): Checks if a given time slot conflicts with any existing bookings.

add_booking(booking): Adds a booking to its sorted list.

remove_booking(booking_id): Removes a booking.

get_all_bookings(): Returns its list of bookings.

MeetingRoomBookingSystem: The main facade that orchestrates all operations. It manages a collection of Room objects and provides the public API for the system.

Attributes:

_rooms: A dictionary mapping room_id to Room objects for O(1) lookup.

_all_bookings_index: A dictionary mapping booking_id to Booking objects for O(1) lookup during cancellation or general querying.

_next_booking_id: An integer counter for generating unique booking IDs.

Methods (Public API):

register_rooms(room_ids)

book_room(room_id, user_id, start_time, end_time)

cancel_booking(booking_id)

check_room_availability_for_slot(room_id, start_time, end_time)

get_room_bookings(room_id)

list_user_bookings(user_id)

Data Structures & Strategy for Efficiency:

MeetingRoomBookingSystem._rooms (dict[str, Room]): Provides O(1) average time complexity to access a Room object by its room_id.

MeetingRoomBookingSystem._all_bookings_index (dict[str, Booking]): Provides O(1) average time complexity to quickly find a Booking object using its booking_id, which is crucial for cancellation.

Room._bookings (list[Booking]): This list is kept sorted by start_time. When checking for overlaps (is_available_for_slot), we iterate through the room's bookings. Since they are sorted, we can optimize by stopping early if the current booking's end time is before our desired slot's start time, or if the current booking's start time is after our desired slot's end time and we've already passed where it could overlap. For the small number of typical bookings per room in a short timeframe, a linear scan over this sorted list is highly performant. For very high booking density and frequent queries, more advanced data structures like interval trees could be considered, but are overkill for a machine coding round.

### Method Clarifications & Efficiency

1. **Booking.overlaps(other_start, other_end)**:
   - This method checks if the current booking overlaps with a given time interval `[other_start, other_end)`.
   - Overlap condition: Two intervals `[s1, e1)` and `[s2, e2)` overlap if `s1 < e2 AND s2 < e1`.
   - Time Complexity: O(1) for a single comparison.

2. **Room.is_available_for_slot(start, end)**:
   - Iterates through the sorted `_bookings` list to check if the given time slot `[start, end)` conflicts with any existing bookings.
   - Optimization: Since `_bookings` is sorted by `start_time`, the iteration stops early if the current booking's `start_time` is after `end`.
   - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of bookings for the room. For small N, this is efficient. For larger N, consider interval trees for O(log N) complexity.

### Future Optimizations

1. **Room.is_available_for_slot**:
   - Current implementation is O(N), where N is the number of bookings in the room.
   - For high-density bookings, consider using an Interval Tree or Segment Tree for O(log N) complexity when checking overlaps.

2. **MeetingRoomBookingSystem.list_user_bookings**:
   - Current implementation iterates over all bookings and filters by user, which is O(M) + O(M log M) for sorting.
   - Optimization: Maintain an inverted index (`_user_bookings_index`) mapping user_id to a pre-sorted list of their bookings. This reduces lookup time to O(K), where K is the number of bookings for the user.
